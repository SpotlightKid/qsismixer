Qsismixer is a frontend gui to control the mixer for Focusrite's Scarlett 6i6 USB sound card on Linux.
The card has a powerful hardware mixer. I find this program easier to use than alsamixer on the terminal or generic mixer GUI's.
Now including static configurations: qsismix can save and load arbitrary configurations from the command line

TODO:
finish the functionality that updates changes from alsa
an options menu would be cool, if qsismix had options
